#  ZARA Technical Test Project

## Project Overview

This project is structured around the following components:

- **Data Layer**: Manages data retrieval and storage. It may include APIs, databases, or other data sources.
  
- **Domain Layer**: Contains the business logic, models, and use cases. It is the core of the application and is independent of external data sources.

- **Presentation Layer**: Handles user interface-related components. It includes view models, views, and other UI elements.

## Project Structure

The project follows the common structure recommended for iOS development:

- **Data**: Contains data source and data manager classes.
  
- **Domain**: Includes business logic and use case classes.
  
- **Presentation**: Contains view models, views, and UI-related components.
  
- **Tests**: Includes unit tests for various components.

## MVVM Pattern

The MVVM pattern (Model-View-ViewModel) is used in the Presentation Layer. Here's how it works:

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic. This is in the Domain Layer.

- **View**: Represents the UI elements and is typically in the storyboards.

- **ViewModel**: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It transforms the data from the Model into a format that the View can easily display and interact with.

## Possible Improvements

While this project serves the purpose of the technical test, there are several areas where it can be enhanced for a larger, production-ready application:

- **Coordinator Pattern**: Consider implementing the Coordinator pattern for better navigation control, especially in larger projects. Coordinators help manage the flow between view controllers and can make the navigation more organized and scalable.

- **Unit Testing**: Expand the test coverage by adding more unit tests to ensure the robustness and correctness of the application components. Additionally, consider adding UI tests to verify the behavior of the user interface under various scenarios.
